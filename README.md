# rocom-service legacy buildsystem
This is the Azure DevOps Buildsystem to build our legacy projects (Microsoft Access / Microsoft Visual Basic 6) on Azure Pipelines.
In order to create a new buildsystem, you need a base HyperV windows vhdx. Simple run `common/Get-WindowsVm.ps1` to download it.

# rocom-service legacy testsystem
This repo also contains a simple testsystem for tau-office.
